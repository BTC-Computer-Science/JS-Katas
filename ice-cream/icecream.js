/* 
 * ICE CREAM KATA
 * This is a kata we will build on.  At level one, it requires knowledge of: 
 * Alerts: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_alert.asp
 * Prompts: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_prompt.asp
 * At level two, it requires knowledge of conditionals:

 */

// Level 1: Prompt for a flavor "What flavor scoop?", then show an alert with "Here's your [flavor] scoop. Enjoy!"

// Level 1: Ask "How many scoops?" and show an alert with "Here's your cone with [scoops] scoops of [flavor]. Enjoy!"

// Level 2: Use conditional logic to check responses where flavor is not equal to chocolate or vanilla:

// 	  If strawberry, alert "Sorry, we're all out of strawberry."

// 	  Else alert "Sorry, we don't carry [flavor]."

// For fun, add other conditionals and responses.
